He has a history of congestive heart failure and obesity (BMI 50.0-59.9), with a recent exacerbation likely triggered by non-compliance with medications and dietary restrictions.\\n\\n**Hospital Course:** During a 7.7-day hospital stay, the patient was stabilized with diuretics (Furosemide, Spironolactone) to manage fluid overload. Amiodarone was initiated for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and Lisinopril was continued to manage hypertension and heart failure. The patient underwent daily assessments for fluid balance and renal function, which showed improvement with decreased edema and normalized electrolytes. \\n\\n**Key Findings and Procedures:** Echocardiogram revealed reduced ejection fraction consistent with systolic heart failure. Renal function was monitored closely due to concurrent acute kidney failure (ICD10: N179). The patient was also treated for anemia related to chronic disease. A comprehensive medication review was conducted, and adjustments were made to optimize heart failure management. \\n\\n**Discharge Condition and Functional Status:** The patient is stable for discharge, with improved symptoms and functional capacity. He can perform activities of daily living with minimal assistance but requires ongoing support from home health services for medication management, dietary education, and mobility assistance.\\n\\n**Medications at Discharge:** The patient is discharged on 5% Dextrose, Acetaminophen, Amiodarone, Clobetasol Propionate cream, Dabigatran Etexilate, Docusate Sodium, Furosemide, Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent, Lisinopril, Metoprolol Succinate XL, Oxycodone (Immediate Release), Potassium Chloride, Senna, Sodium Chloride 0.9% flush, and Spironolactone. \\n\\n**Follow-Up Plan:** The patient is advised to follow up with cardiology within one week and primary care within two weeks. Home health services will initiate within 48 hours post-discharge to monitor vital signs, medication adherence, and provide education on heart failure management.'}"

Initial evaluation revealed bibasilar crackles, elevated BNP, chest radiograph with pulmonary interstitial/alveolar edema and a focal consolidation. He was diagnosed with acute pulmonary edema (ICD-10 J81.0) complicated by pneumonia and type 2 myocardial infarction. Admission was emergent; length of stay 3.2 days.\\n\\nHospital course: He was stabilized with supplemental oxygen, IV loop diuretics (furosemide) with brisk diuresis and marked symptomatic improvement, and guideline-directed secondary prevention therapy for ischemic heart disease (aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol). Empiric antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) were administered. He developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure that responded to supplemental O2 without need for intubation. Acute kidney injury was present on admission and improved with careful diuresis and fluid/electrolyte management. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms were managed per CIWA protocol with diazepam. Electrolytes were repleted as indicated. Cardiology and nephrology were consulted; troponin elevation consistent with type 2 MI related to supply–demand mismatch. No invasive coronary intervention was performed during this admission.\\n\\nKey findings and procedures: CXR with pulmonary edema and focal consolidation; elevated BNP and troponin; transient hypoxemic respiratory failure. Right pleural drainage/decompression was performed (ICD-10-PCS 03HY32Z) with clinical improvement. Renal function trended toward baseline prior to discharge.\\n\\nDischarge condition and functional status: Patient is clinically improved, hemodynamically stable, on room air intermittently and requiring low-flow supplemental oxygen with planned home oxygen evaluation. Able to ambulate with supervision due to deconditioning and mild dyspnea; independent with most ADLs but requires assistance for complex medication administration and mobility safety.\\n\\nMedications and follow-up: Discharged on aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, furosemide, ferrous sulfate, folic acid and a short course of outpatient ceftriaxone/azithromycin via home health as arranged. Home health nursing established for IV antibiotic administration, daily vitals, medication reconciliation, wound/pleural drain check and fall-risk/safety assessment.
